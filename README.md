## Background
You will find here scripts as used in the msc-phygeo-class-of-2016-creuden course which are part of the [regular course](http://moc.environmentalinformatics-marburg.de/doku.php?id=start) within the [MSc Environmental Geography](http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb19/studium/studiengaenge/msc-environmentalgeography/index_html) at Marburg University.
